# Overview

The Unreal engine plugin offers an ocean material with Gerstner waves for a sphere.&#x20;

It can be used either on a highly subdivided sphere (such a sphere made in 3d modeling software is included in the plugin), or in any other mesh with a quadtree/octree system offered by other plugins.&#x20;

The only requirement to any procedural mesh is that it should support world position offset.
