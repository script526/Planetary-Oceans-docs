# Using just the material (no buoyancy)

Assign the `MI_PlanetOcean` to the sphere mesh of your choice.  You can also use the `SM_OceanMeshGenerated` mesh. If you want to change the polygon density of this mesh, see [Generating ocean mesh](using-with-static-mesh/generating-ocean-mesh.md).

You have wide variety of parameters, allowing you to achieve the style you're going for. Here're some features:

* Wave parameters (direction, length, amplitude, steepness etc.)
* Subsurface scattering
* Waves attenuation at the shoreline
* Masking out water
* Wave and beach foam
* Scrolling normals (textures) on top of wave normals
